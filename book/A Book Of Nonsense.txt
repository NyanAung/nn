A Book Of Nonsense
by Lear, Edward

Price: $16.95


Edward Lear's A Book of Nonsense, originally published in 1845, is an exuberant collection of nonsense limericks, illustrated throughout with Lear's usual sharp eye for the fantastic, the bizarre, and the grotesque. This glorious gallery of Victorian eccentrics is now reproduced in a beautiful, full-color edition that reveals Lear's imagination at its most fertile.
